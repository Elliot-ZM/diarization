Speaker A : I want to ask about something else how many people currently work at the ethical financial stability oversight cancel.

Speaker B : Play some comments on this earlier so i weren't here so i'll just clarify the way out sockworks is there people who directly work under a sock and there are people who work in all the different about the direct number direct number came in if you add up there's hundreds of people if you add up all the different agencies and how many people well there's a there's a small group within treasury and then there's the office of financial research with weave cut significantly because we thought those resources weren't being used appropriately.

Speaker A : Financial research isn't valuable.

Speaker B : Again we didn't think that was the best use of taxpayer money so it was really a function of we felt that the the resources within the different agencies which are quite ample and quite significant that are dedicated to this.

Speaker A : How many people work at a socket only enough suck.

Speaker B : You got we probably have went when you say at a sock are you referring within the treasury department that are only thing i didn't like about 10 people that are directly in the treasury work on that but we probably have 50 people within treasury.

Speaker A : Work just for a sock.

Speaker B : There's a small number of how many.

Speaker B : It got its its roughly is it slightly less than a dozen people.

Speaker A : Less than a dozen do you know what the maximum number was.

Speaker B : I'm comparing this to the middle of tarp okay in the middle of the financial area one by the way there were cruisers.

Speaker A : Thank you very much.
