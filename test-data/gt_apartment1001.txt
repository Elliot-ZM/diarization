A: Good afternoon, Jim. This is Olivia.

B: Oh, hi, Olivia. How can I help you?

A: I'm going to be moving out.

B: Oh, really? When are you leaving?

A: I'll be leaving on the last day of June.

B: Any particular reason?

A: I got a new job.

B: Congratulations! What is it?

A: I'm going to be an ESL instructor at Pasadena City College.

B: Great! By the way, what's ESL?

A: ESL stands for English as a Second Language.

B: Well, I'm glad it wasn't your neighbors causing you to move.

A: Just because they play their TV loud enough for the whole complex?

B: Yes, I know. I'm going to have another talk with them.

A: Anyway, it's been nice knowing you for these past few years.

B: You, too. Keep in touch, and good luck with your new job.
